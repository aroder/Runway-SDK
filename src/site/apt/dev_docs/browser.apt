Browser Development

  Browser is used as a generic term to include all Runway code that is shipped to the browser (Javascript, HTML, CSS, XML, ...). Runway's browser code is located in the <runwaysdk-browser> project under <src/main/(javascript)>. This code is bundled into a jar and included as a dependency by projects using Runway (<<This feature not supported by Tomcat 6>>).
  
  The <runwaysdk-browser-test> project is a fully functioning Runway SDK webapp project and includes test code under <src/main/webapp>. To test your javascript code against this test webapp you will run a <"boot servers"> launch. This will deploy the runway test webapp and boot tomcat. You will then be able to access the tests at

  {{http://localhost:8080/runwaysdk-browser-test/MasterTestLauncher.jsp}}

 For javascript/html/css changes you can quickly update the server (without rebooting it) with your changes by running the <"deploy presentation"> launch. <"redeploy"> will hot-deploy new jars to the live tomcat instance, refreshing everything.
