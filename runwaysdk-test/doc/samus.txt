--------------


Tomcat is installed at $CATALINA_HOME and is running under user `tomcat`. I wrote a custom init.d script called tomcat to allow for standard operations using the linux service command, i.e.:

sudo service tomcat stop
sudo service tomcat restart
sudo service tomcat start


----------------

mvn test will run the tests, but since UeberTestSuite requires Runway to be compiled as well (environment=runway) running the tests requires 2 commands:
 1) mvn compile (@ runwaysdk-main)
 2) mvn test (@ runwaysdk-test)

So, I wrote an ant script that runs these 2 tasks and the CI box is running that ant script.

parameters used when running the ant script:

build file : runwaysdk-test/src/main/scripts/ant/ant-maven-ci.xml
Properties: maven.home=/usr/local/apache-maven-3.0.5
Java Options : -Xms512m -Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m


-----------------

If you're reinstalling the CI box you will likely get an error saying Runway can't find master.properties. To fix this you can either:
  - comment out all the properties at the beginning of the ant-maven-ci ant script that reference RunwayProperties, those are unnecessary and remenants of an ant build
  - or manually run a mvn compile on runwaysdk-test only once just to bootstrap the system. You don't actually have to compile the project (You can ctrl+c once it starts compiling) mvn just needs to go far enough to copy the resources to target.
