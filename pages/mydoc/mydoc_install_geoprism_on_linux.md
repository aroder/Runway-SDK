2. Search for buildhelper (by Sonatype) and install.

## Install And Setup The Database

1.  Install PostgreSQL 9.0 + using whatever method you prefer.
2.  After installing PostgreSQL create a database called "template-postgis".  
3.  Spatially enable the template-postgis database by installing PostGIS with the SQL command:

```
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

## Download and Load GeoPrism Into Eclipse
<!-- ### 1. Download RunwaySDK

1.  Download or clone the RunwaySDK project from the [Github repo](https://github.com/terraframe/Runway-SDK.git).
2.  Import RunwaySDK into you Eclipse environment.

### 2. Download RunwaySDK-GIS

1.  Download or clone the RunwaySDK-GIS project from the [Github repo](https://github.com/terraframe/Runway-SDK-GIS.git).
2.  Import RunwaySDK-GIS into you Eclipse environment. -->

### 1. Load GeoPrism Into Eclipse

1.  In Eclipse go to 'File -> Import -> Git -> Projects From Git -> Clone URI'.
2.  Set:
*  URI : git@github.com:terraframe/geoprism.git
*  Host : github.com
*  Repository path : terraframe/geoprism.git
*  User : git
3.  Click "Next".  Follow the wizard, and when asked to select projects to import select the following (at a minimum):
*  dev
*  master
4.  Click to download the repository
5.  Select "Import existing projects"
6.  Select all of the projects to import and make sure that "Search for nested projects" is checked.

### 2. Configure GeoPrism
1.  Configure the database properties by modifying the database properties in server.properties in geoprism-server to:
*  user=geoprism
*  password=geoprism
*  databaseName=geoprism

### 3. Create And Configure The GeoPrism Database
1.  Create a new database called 'geoprism' using template-postgis as a template to ensure PostGIS is included.
2.  If you don't have a template-postgis database you can enable postgis by running the SQL command:

```
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

## Install Oracle Java 8

### 1. Configure A Basic Maven Build
1.  Create a new Maven build defining the following properties:
*  goals : clean install -P geoprism-cargo-run-debug
*  params : configuration.dir
3. Define the base directory as ${workspace_loc:/geoprism}
2. Add a new parameter:
* Name: configuration.dir
* Value: ${workspace_loc:/geoprism-platform}/Customer_projects/<Project Config Directory>

### 2. Install Ansible (optional)
