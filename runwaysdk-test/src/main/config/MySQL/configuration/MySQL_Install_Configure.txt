Install MySQL
-------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Download MySQL version 4.1.X from www.mysql.com

2.  To install the windows version, unzip the download file and run setup.exe

3.  Make sure to uncheck the option to make the database a "strict" database.

4.  After installation, make sure that the <mysql home>\bin directory is in your PATH variable.
This will allow you to run MySQL command line utilities at the command prompt.


Configure the database
-------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Make sure the MySQL service (or process for you Linux people) is running.

2.  Log onto the database as root.  By default, the root user does not have a password.  At
the command prompt, type:

    mysql -u root mysql

where "-u" means user and "mysql" is the name of the database instance you are logging into.
You should now see the mysql command prompt:

mysql>


3.  Give the root database user a password.  This really isn't an issue for development purposes,
but a good idea nonetheless.  At the command prompt, type:

    UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('new_password') WHERE user='root';

Where 'new_password' is the new root password.  Every sql statement must be terminated with a
semicolin.  Also, whenever a database user's profile is updated, run the following command:

    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

4.  Our application tables will reside in their own database instance, called "runwaydb".  To
create this database, type the following at the command prompt:

    CREATE DATABASE runwaydb;

5.  Create a new database user for our application.  All communication between our Java application
and the database will occur through this user:

    (windows)
    INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    VALUES('%','runway',PASSWORD('runway'));
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

    OR

    (linux)
    INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    VALUES('localhost','runway',PASSWORD('runway'));
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

    OR

    (MySql 5.0)
    CREATE USER 'runway'@'*.*' IDENTIFIED BY 'runway';

the PASSWORD() function encrypts the value you give it.  So, the user name is "runway" with a
password of "runway".


6.  We now need to give additional permissions to our "runway" user.  The application, through
the "runway" account, will read, write, modify, and delete records in the application's
database, which is "fwdb".  In addition to CRUD, it will add, modify, and drop tables and
columns in the database as new business types are added, modified, and removed.  This means that
"runway" needs to be able to do practically everything.  So, we will grant him all privileges
on our newly created database instance (fwdb).

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON runwaydb.* TO runway@'%';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

7.  Now, log on to the new database as the new user.  Logout root by typing "exit".
Then, log on as the new user by typing at the command prompt:

    mysql -u runway -p runwaydb

where "-u" is the username (in this case, "runway").  The "-p" flag actually does NOT mean
the password will follow.  Rather, it means that you want to be prompted for the password
within the mysql executable.  This is important for security reasons.  Think about it, if you
are in a Unix/Linux environment and you provide the password on the same command line as you
invoke the mysql executable, another user could run a "ps -ef | grep" and see the password.
The "fwdb" means you want to log your user into the "fwdb" database instance.  You will then
be prompted for a password, so use the value "runway".
