--------------


Tomcat is installed at $CATALINA_HOME and is running under user `tomcat`. I wrote a custom init.d script called tomcat to allow for standard operations using the linux service command, i.e.:

sudo service tomcat stop
sudo service tomcat restart
sudo service tomcat start


----------------

mvn test will run the tests, but since UeberTestSuite requires Runway to be compiled as well (environment=runway) running the tests requires 2 commands:
 1) mvn compile (@ runwaysdk-main)
 2) mvn test (@ ruwnaysdk-test)

So, I wrote an ant script that runs these 2 tasks and the CI box is running that ant script.

parameters used when running the ant script:
