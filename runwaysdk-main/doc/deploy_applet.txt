Steps to deploy the upload applet:

1) Run the export_upload task in ant. This should write a jar of the classes used in the upload applet
     to the root of the web container.
     
2) Copy rmiio-2.0.2.jar and commons-logging-1.0.4.jar to the root of the web container

3) Create a certificate:
    keytool -genkey
    keytool -selfcert

4) Sign the upload.jar in the web container: jarsigner -signedJar signed.jar -storepass keystore upload.jar mykey

5) Sign the rmiio-2.0.2.jar in the web container: jarsigner -signedJar rmiio-signed.jar -storepass keystore rmiio-2.0.2.jar mykey

6) Delete rmiio-2.0.2.jar from the web container

7) Copy images in folder trunk/web/applet/images to the images folder in the web container

8) Done!!!
