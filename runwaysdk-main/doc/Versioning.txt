Versioning uses a modified schema (version.xsd) which incorporates datatype.xsd.
The only differences is that versioning has two root level tags, doIt and undoIt.
In the doIt section the domain model changes required to update from the previous version are specified.
In the undoIt section the domain model changes required to revert to the previous model are specified.
Each version of the domain model is specified in its own xml file, however all files must in the same directory.
All xml files must be of the name schema_[version number].xml
In order to change the current version of a system run the ant task import_version with the arguments
  -1) The fully qualified path to the folder containing all the schema.xml files
  -2) The desired version number. (The initial version is considered version 0)
