Getting Started : For Runway SDK API Developers

  Welcome. Before proceeding make sure that your machine meets the prerequisites defined in {{{./../usage.html}Usage}}.
  
  Runway SDK is hosted using Github. 
  
  {{https://github.com/terraframe/Runway-SDK}}
  
* Download The Project Using Git

  Using Eclipse:
  
+------+
File -> Import -> Git -> Projects From Git -> URI
+------+

  Set the URI to:
  
+------+
git@github.com:terraframe/Runway-SDK.git
+------+

  Change nothing else, then click next. Follow the wizard, and when asked to select projects to import select the following (at a minimum):
  
    * runwaysdk-main
    
    * runwaysdk-common
    
    * runwaysdk-client
    
    * runwaysdk-server
    
    * runwaysdk-test

  
* How to run Runway's Tests (through Eclipse):
 
    * In Eclipse execute a clean and build of all projects.
  
    * Run [test] mvn exec;java -Drebuild-database.launch (in runwaysdk-test/launches/maven)
  
    * Junit Run UeberTestSuite.launch

  The rebuild database script reads the properties files from the target directory. If you change a profile you MUST do a build before you launch the rebuild database script or it will use the stale values.



* How to run Runway's Tests (using the Maven CLI):
  
  * Run [test] mvn clean test.launch
