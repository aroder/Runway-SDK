2) When doing a full rebuild in ANT that executes many targets, a failure in
one target does not always end the entire process. This means the build will
continue when it should not (e.g., deploying files to Tomcat when rebuilding
the develop environment failed).

3) When deploying for they very first time, there are some dependencies on files or directories that don't exist yet.  Specifically:
    -deploy.xml defines tasks that reference ${server.lib}
    -TerraFrameClassLoader references ${client.bin}, ${server.bin}, ${common.bin}

10) Tomcat must be restarted when metadata changes are made in the develop environment because those aren't reflected in the cache. There needs
to be a way to sync this up to drastically increase development time.

26) The following generates duplicate column aliases in the generated SQL (example in ValueQueryStructTest.java) :
      QueryFactory qf = new QueryFactory();
      
      ValueQuery vQ = qf.valueQuery();
      BusinessDAOQuery query = qf.businessDAOQuery(QueryMasterSetup.childQueryInfo.getType());
      
      AttributeStruct aStruct = query.aStruct("queryStruct");
      vQ.SELECT(aStruct);
      vQ.WHERE(aStruct.NE(""));
      
      i = vQ.getIterator();
      
      if(!i.hasNext())
      {
        fail("A query did not return any results when it should have");
      }
      
      System.out.print("Searching through objects\n");
      System.out.print(vQ.getSQL());
      
      while (i.hasNext())
      {
        ValueObject obj = i.next(); // ERROR
        System.out.print(obj.getId() + "\n");
      }


29) version.xsd references datatype.xsd with the path ../../trunk/profiles/datatype.xsd but trunk/ doesn't exist in a new project via the creator

37) Bug in query API: A generated reference attribute getter, when combined with a relationship query, matches the reference attribute against the parent class.
//    Disease disease = getDisease();
//    
//    BrowserRootQuery q = new BrowserRootQuery(f);
//    InactivePropertyQuery ipQ = new InactivePropertyQuery(f);
//    
//    ipQ.AND(ipQ.getDisease().containsExactly(disease));
//    ipQ.AND(ipQ.getInactive().EQ(false));
//    
//    q.WHERE(q.getTerm().inactiveProperties(ipQ));
//    Produces this erroneous SQL: browserRoot.term = browserRoot.id

1) .*Query metadata names can't exist because "Query" is stripped out (ex: SavedQuery won't work as a type name).
  - this should at least throw an error at time of definition
